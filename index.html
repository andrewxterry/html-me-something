            <h3>My Life in the Mountains</h3>
            <p>As a former outdoor guide and PSIA certified 
                ski instructor in Mammoth Lakes, CA, I had countless adventures in the mountains.
                 From skiing under a full-moon, to being chased by a startled black bear, I attempted to see and experience 
                 everything I could from the great outdoors.</p>

            <div class='moon'><h3>Skiing under a full moon</h3>

            <h3>Living Among the Bears</h3>

            <p>Mammoth Lakes, CA is home to approximately 40 bears. 
                They attempt to eat anything that isn’t bolted down. 
                Living with bears in your community is equal parts responsible trash management, 
                safe wilderness practices, and trust – trust in your neighbor to do the responsible thing, and trust that the 
                bear isn’t truly interested in eating you! </p>

            <h3>What the Outdoors Can Do for Us</h3>
            <h5>and what we can do for it</h5>

            <p>The mountains and the great-out-doors open a door for us to experience a truly breath-taking experience. 
                Overwhelmed by the sense of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_(philosophy)'>
                sublime</a>, 
                we can remind ourselves how truly small we are – 
                and how <strong>BIG</strong> our world is. However, it is up to us to maintain that; 
                to care for our surroundings. I encourage everyone to get out side and explore, 
                but to do so responsibly and with care. Nature is enchanting, but fragil. </p>
